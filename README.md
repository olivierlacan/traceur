# Traceur

A simple personal COVID-19 contact tracing Gantt-chart for friends and family.

![Example of the Traceur spreadsheet in the Numbers application][1]

## Usage

Download either the Excel, Numbers, or CSV files. Open them with the respective
apps. The CSV file is compatible with either Numbers, Excel, Google Sheets, or
any other spreadsheet application that can ingest comma-separated values.

Copy the appropriate icons into given day where an event occured. You can easily
copy the yellow background for the incubation period by using `Option` +
`Command` + `C` and `Option` + `Command` + `V` in Apple Numbers. There should
be similar `Copy Style` and `Paste Style` options in other applications.
